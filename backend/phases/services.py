"""
Extracts candidate SchoolPhase entries from an uploaded academic calendar
PDF. Renders each page to an image and sends them to OpenAI as vision
input - tried plain text extraction first (pypdf) during development and
it came out too garbled to trust (this calendar is a dense, color-coded
table layout, not prose), so this reads it the same way a human would:
by looking at it.

Only ever returns candidates for review - nothing here writes to the
database. That happens through the existing, already-validated
POST /api/v1/phases/ endpoint once an admin confirms each one.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are reading an official USTP academic calendar (a color-coded table \
document, not prose) to extract periods relevant to a STUDENT-facing chatbot's guidance \
banner. The calendar spans one academic year across two calendar years - use the "Summary \
of Periods" table (1st semester, 2nd semester, Mid-Year Term start/end dates, which DO \
include explicit years) as your anchor for resolving which calendar year every other \
"Month Day" entry belongs to, since most remarks-table rows only give a month and day.

Only extract periods a STUDENT would care about and might ask the chatbot about:
- Enrollment periods (early enrollment, regular enrollment, adding/dropping subjects)
- Examination periods (preliminary, midterm, pre-final, final)
- Application for graduation
- Orientation / Week of Welcome
- Submission of enrollment list (student-facing deadline)
- Any other period a student would plan around

Do NOT extract:
- Plain public holidays with no academic significance (Independence Day, Christmas, etc.)
- Faculty-only or administrative-only items (grade submission deadlines for faculty, \
faculty evaluation, faculty leave, promotional list submission, BOR resolutions)
- Single commemorative dates with no action for students (birthdays, death anniversaries)
- Anything that isn't a real dated period on the calendar - never invent one

For each extracted period, write a short, natural guidance_message (1-2 sentences) a \
chatbot could show a student during that window, and 2-3 suggested_questions a student \
might realistically tap to ask about it. Use the calendar's own official label as the \
name, cleaned up (no trailing "(Undergraduate Levels)" type qualifiers unless needed to \
disambiguate UG from Graduate versions of the same period - if both exist with different \
dates, keep them as separate entries with distinguishing names).

All dates must be YYYY-MM-DD. If a date range spans two months without a year change \
(e.g. "Jul. 28 - Aug. 1"), infer both dates use the same year from context."""
